    "The management team at AAVAIL is preparing to deploy a large number of teams each tasked with integration into a different new market.  They claim to have a optimized the teams fairly with respect to skills and experience.  They are asking you to come up with a framework to evaluate the makeup of their teams.  They have not finished hiring and creating all of the teams so naturally before you even get the data you wanted to get a head start.\n",

This is an inherent risk of using inferrential statistics.  Fortunately, there are several techniques to mitigate the risk.\n",

One issue with statistical inference is that there are situations where [performing multiple tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem) is a  logical way to accomplish a task, but it comes at the expense of an increased rate of false positives or Type I errors.\n",

One additional variant of GLMs are hierarchical or multilevel models that provide even more insight into this types of dataset.
